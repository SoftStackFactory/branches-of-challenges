# Branches of Challenges

This repository is designed with the intent to teach debugging through the
javascript console, elements, application, and eventually the network tabs.


## Challenges
### Easy:
1. ch-easy-01 - HTML: the switch case is not working for the lobby page when I click on "Create" it does not show the header for the create page.
2. ch-easy-02 - TS: something is wrong with the transpiling, figure out what and solve it.


### Medium:
1. ch-medium-01 - HTML: the *ngFor is working on the posts, but not the drafts. Solve the issue.

### Difficult:
1. ch-difficult-01 - (not given): When a user clicks on a single schedule item from the Posts list, they should navigate to the ScheduleViewPage. My issue is that I get a run time error when I click on a schedule item. I was in the process of adding a new page named `ScheduleView` to navigate to from the `LobbyPage`. I used the `ionic g page ScheduleView` command to create the page, then I imported it into the `src/pages/lobby/lobby.ts` so I can navigate to the page. I then added the (click) attribute to an html element in order to call a function I defined as `scheduleClicked` in the .ts file of the LobbyPage.
