# Branches of Challenges

This repository is designed with the intent to teach debugging through the
javascript console, elements, application, and eventually the network tabs.


## Challenges
### Easy:
1. ch-easy-01 - HTML: the switch case is not working for the lobby page when I click on "Create" it does not show the header for the create page.
2. ch-easy-02 - TS: something is wrong with the transpiling, figure out what and solve it.


### Medium:
1. ch-medium-01 - HTML: the *ngFor is working on the posts, but not the drafts. Solve the issue.
